- Implement HTTP method switch based on command descriptor.
- Fortify Driver::Execute method (From* methods may throw exceptions).
- Ref()/Unref() streams during Driver::Execute.
- Implement proper thread affinity.
- There should be EventuallyUnref() method which is thread-safe and
  which eventually Unref()'s Ref()'ed object. Exactly this method
  should be used with TIntrusivePtr on C++ side.
- Investigate common allocation sizes and migrate to SlabAllocator.
- Merge {Read,Write} and {Read,Write}Synchronous into a single method
  (i. e. if a callback was passed then perform asynchronously).
- Measure performance when, e. g., writing to a file.
- Investigate whether it is costy to allocate uv_work_t structures
  on every asynchronous call.
- Maybe cache allocated and used request structures.
- Implement write queue threshold to limit memory usage.
- Investigate all 'new' call sites for potential memory leaks due to exceptions.
- We can pass as HTTP configuration some JS structure and modify it in real-time.

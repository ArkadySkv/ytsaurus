- When performing POST and PUT queries post-pone output generation
  until the whole output will be produced and set proper status code.
  (cf. 413 Request Entity Too Large for limiting input data size)
- Rename TDriverRequest::Arguments to *::Parameters
- Rename TCommandDescriptor::CommandName to *::Name
- Implement proper thread affinity.
- Investigate common allocation sizes and migrate to SlabAllocator.
- Merge {Read,Write} and {Read,Write}Synchronous into a single method
  (i. e. if a callback was passed then perform asynchronously).
- Measure performance when, e. g., writing to a file.
- Maybe cache allocated and used request structures.
- Investigate all 'new' call sites for potential memory leaks due to exceptions.

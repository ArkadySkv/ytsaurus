- Extract TNodeJSOutputStream::Pull to an asynchronous method
  in order to avoid locking on Mutex.
- Extract TNodeJSInputStream::Push to an asynchronous method
  in order to avoid locking on Mutex.
- Investigate common allocation sizes and migrate to SlabAllocator.
- Merge {Read,Write} and {Read,Write}Synchronous into a single method
  (i. e. if a callback was passed then perform asynchronously).
- Measure performance when, e. g., writing to a file.
- Investigate whether it is costy to allocate uv_work_t structures
  on every asynchronous call.
- Maybe cache allocated and used request structures.
- Implement write queue threshold to limit memory usage.
- Callbacks throughout the interface.
